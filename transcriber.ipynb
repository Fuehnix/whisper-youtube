      " In the body, pH affects everything from cardiac contractility to enzyme function. Not surprisingly, the body's acid-base status is tightly regulated by various systems to keep the pH within that sweet, sweet Goldilocks zone. But, as is the theme in this course, pathology rears its ugly head and shoves either acids or bases out of balance. And, in response, the body tries as hard as it can to compensate. In this sketch, we'll figure out whether we're dealing with an acid or base problem, and whether it's stemming from a breathing problem, aka respiratory, or an issue with ingesting, metabolizing, excreting, vomiting, or pooping acids and bases, aka metabolic. For that, we must take a journey to the land of more acid. Here, we'll meet Frodo, on his quest to restore the balance. You see, he has severe diarrhea, and therefore bears an excess of protons that weighs down his very soul. In trousers. His uncle bestowed upon him this diarrhea on the night of his name day, lest he succumb to the acidosis, for he could not adequately compensate with increased respirations. Probably because of all that pipe weed he was smoking. And so Frodo set out to destroy the diarrhea. At the forges of Mount Acid, armed with only a dagger and a formula. A gift from Lady Winter. Alright, we're going to play all-seeing-eye here for a moment. Let me point out some of the landmarks here in more acid. To detect an acid or base disturbance in your patient, you need to get an arterial blood gas, or ABG. A standard ABG tells you the pH, CO2 level, and calculated bicarbonate level. A normal arterial pH is around 7.4. A normal CO2 is around 40 mmHg. And a normal bicarbonate is around 24. Let's start with pH. Acidosis means your pH level will be low, less than 7.35. Here in more acid, all the pathologies causing acidosis, whether metabolic or respiratory, will be placed low in the scene, where the dangerous acid lava flows. Remember, low in the scene means low pH. Alkalosis means your pH will be high, greater than 7.45. On test day, think of the upper half of the scene, where the pathologies causing alkalosis roam the mountainside, next to those brilliant blue basic pools. Again, that's high in the scene for high pH. We're going to head first to the bottom of the scene, however, as our journey begins with acidosis, the cause of which can be divided into respiratory or metabolic processes. And as we focus in on Frodo's travel companion, Gapwise, I think it's pretty obvious which category we're starting with. Stuffing his face, as usual. In this scene, that's our theme for metabolic processes. So back to that ABG. The three values we care about are pH, bicarb, and CO2. pH we've already discussed. We're acidotic, so we expect the pH to be low. Which is why we're low into the scene. Next, bicarb. The most important component of the pH buffering system of the body. This is how your body resists pH changes. And in the setting of metabolic acidosis specifically, what we're doing is disturbing that right side of the equation, causing bicarbonate levels to decrease. As we'll soon illustrate, we can do this by adding a bunch of acid to the system, causing the buffering equilibrium to shift to the left, thereby decreasing bicarb. This is what happens when your patient is in ketoacidosis, or ingests methylene glycol. Alternatively, we can directly drop bicarb. In most cases, when a bicarb is lost, its corresponding proton is retained. This is accomplished either by excreting bicarb in an excessive amount of diarrhea, or with a kidney abnormality that decreases bicarb reabsorption or production. Yep, the kidney can actually make brand new bicarb. When it's not broken, that is. All right, back to the scene at hand. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a decrease in bicarb. As depicted by the bicarbonate baking soda tumbling out of Gapwise's pack as he traverses the gap. There's one more part of the ABG we haven't discussed yet, and that's PaCO2, a measure of the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide in the blood. This value is predominantly controlled by the lungs. Increase ventilation, and you breathe off CO2. Decrease ventilation, and CO2 accumulates. But wait, metabolic acidosis has to do with peeing and pooping and eating and stuff. You didn't say anything about breathing. Well, the other half of the story is about compensation. In the setting of metabolic acidosis, when that H plus is accumulating, the lungs kick in, increasing ventilation and blowing off CO2. This helps move that equilibrium even further to the left, thereby decreasing that H plus back toward normal. The theme of these compensatory mechanisms is that they never quite get the pH back to baseline. But they try. All right, we're acidic here. The lungs are trying to help out, so they blow off more CO2, trying to raise that pH a little, you know? This is called a compensatory respiratory alkalosis, characterized by decreased PaCO2 and symbolized here by carbon fumes that are low to the ground. Remnants of that morning's breakfast, I'm guessing. Come on, guys, you've got to cover your tracks better than that. By the way, as the sketch progresses, we'll always match each primary acid-base disturbance with its compensatory mechanism. This will be reflected in the partially compensated lab values. And in metabolic acidosis, that means low pH, low bicarb, and low compensatory CO2. The next step in diagnosing the cause of metabolic acidosis is to look at a little thing we in the land of more acid call the anion gap. Remembering back to our sketches on volume disorders, if you watched it, that is. Shame upon your house if you didn't. There are major anions and cations in all fluid compartments of the body. From a pure chemistry perspective, the sum of all the negative charges, or anions, in the body must equal all the positive charges, or cations, to maintain isoelectricity, which sounds a lot cooler than it is. The extracellular space, and therefore the blood plasma, is dominated by three ions, the cation sodium and the anions bicarbonate and chloride. That said, there are many more ions and negatively charged molecules, such as albumin, that don't exist in as high of a concentration, but still play incredibly important roles. And we just kind of shove them all into that orange box up there. That's the anion gap. Put it another way. We can calculate the anion gap by subtracting the plasma bicarbonate and chloride concentrations, the anions on the right, from the plasma sodium concentration, the cation on the left. The normal anion gap is around 8 to 12. In this scene, the equation for the anion gap is depicted on this message carved into the stone next to the gap. None shall cross. Notice how the N-H-C is highlighted. To remind you of sodium minus bicarb minus chloride, there are two doors to choose from in metabolic acidosis. Normal anion gap or increased anion gap. Let's see what kind of acids can increase that gap. This means that there are a significant number of other negative charges floating around. You can think of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis as being caused by a preponderance of sneaky, unmeasured organic acids driving the bicarb down. This makes even more sense when you think about that isoelectric concept. If bicarb and anion is low, there must be other negative charges, aka organic acids, there to take its place, since the total number of cations hasn't changed. Arithmetic-wise, if you subtract the bicarb and chloride from the sodium and you get a value over 12, think anion gap acidosis. In this scene, to depict increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, we have Frodo's travel companion here jumping that gap. Notice, too, that the supplies on the side of his travel pack evoke an image of values greater than 12. The sneaky acids increasing that gap can all be remembered by the helpful acronym MUDPILES, which stands for methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, propylene glycol, iron and isoniazid, lactate, ethanol and ethylene glycol, and... salicylates. Oh, shoot! Looks like one of the gorks has captured Ozymle, as the gork rummages through the dwarf's things and waits for him to marinate. Let's go through the causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, starting with the M in MUDPILES, methanol, present in windshield washer fluid, sterno, and solvents for paints. Why Ozymle brought it along? Only one can guess. After ingestion of methanol, it's converted into formic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formic acid damages the optic nerve and can make you go blind. So be careful about methanol byproducts contaminating that dwarven moonshine. Next up, the U in MUDPILES, uremia, measured on labs as increased blood urea nitrogen, or BUN. You see, dwarves are known for two things. One, their love of gems and precious metals. And two, their love of fast food. BUN is a component of renal azotemia. When BUN and creatinine increase in the serum due to acute or chronic kidney disease and decreased GFR. In the setting of decreased kidney function, however, it's not just urea that builds up in the serum. The kidney also has trouble filtering out other organic acids and waste products such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and uric acid. Remember, this is why we installed that acid volcano at the Chronic Kidney Disease Museum. Metabolic acidosis, here we come. The D in MUDPILES is for diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA, symbolized by a locked candy jar that can only be accessed with a delicious candy key. A ketone key, if you will. DKA is an acute complication of type 1 diabetes. Over in the endocrine unit, we'll portray the ketones as the winnings at the end of the Candy 200 race. Two ketones in particular will be portrayed by acidic sour candies. The organic acids, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Be sure to check out that video for more info on the pathogenesis of DKA. Go ahead, what are you waiting for? Wait, no, not right now. I miss you already. Other conditions can cause the buildup of ketones as well, including alcoholism, starvation, or a ketogenic diet. So watch out. Alright, time for the P in PILES. Propylene glycol. Like methanol, this alcohol can be found in various products. Including antifreeze. It's also metabolized into acid by alcohol dehydrogenase. Again, not really sure what Ozzemley had in mind there. Maybe like a solvent for something? Moving on. The I in MUDPILES is for iron and isoniazid. Acute iron poisoning can cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis when ferric ions get hydrated and release protons. And isoniazid we met in Sketchy Farm. It's our isolate ranger used as a component of ripe therapy for the treatment of tuberculosis. It can cause numerous neurologic side effects, including seizure, which leads to lactic acidosis. A perfect segue into the L in MUDPILES. Lactic acid. Represented by Ozzemley's expired, undoubtedly acidic milk. Lactic acid builds up in times of hypoxia. Like during that seizure we just mentioned. Cells switch over to anaerobic metabolism, which means lactate production and metabolic acidosis. Alcoholism is another famous cause of lactic acidosis. An overworked alcohol dehydrogenase results in excess NADH, which drives the production of even more lactate. The E in MUDPILES is ethylene glycol, the main component of antifreeze. Again, like we saw with the other alcohols, it's metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase into acid. Oxalic acid particularly likes to combine with calcium and precipitate in the renal tubules causing obstruction. So many reasons not to ingest antifreeze. And finally, the S in MUDPILES. Salicylic acid, also known as aspirin. At Sketchy, our symbol for aspirin is the ASA umpire. And in this scene, we've incorporated an umpire's gear into the armor worn by the gorg. Not only is salicylic acid an acid, it's toxic to mitochondria, leading to tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis. Whew, boy, big list, right? Many of these substances are associated with specific clinical presentations and laboratory profiles which are beyond the scope of this sketch. However, to narrow down the differential just a little bit, we can calculate the osmolal gap. It turns out that methanol, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol aren't just acids. They're also active osmols and affect the calculation of serum osmolality. Having trouble deciphering the mysterious equation on the wall there? It's an ancient language called algebra. Don't worry, we can solve this riddle together. Just know that the most important osmol in the plasma is sodium, multiplied by 2 because it's associated with some sort of counteranion. Glucose, BUN, and ethanol can also contribute to the serum osmolality, especially during times of hyperglycemia, uremia, and acute alcohol poisoning. But under normal circumstances, sodium is the main component. Now, an osmol gap is exactly what it sounds like. The equation above gives you the calculated osmolality. Subtract this from the actual osmolality you get back from the lab, and you'll notice a gap. There are some extra osmols that we're not accounting for. Normally, this gap is pretty small, less than 10. But throw methanol, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol into the mix, and now you have a bunch of extra osmols and the gap increases. To remind you of an osmolal gap greater than 10, we've placed Osmly above his trusty axon shield, forming a 10 shape. And to remind you that specifically methanol, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol act as osmols to increase the gap, we've highlighted the E, P, and M on the cond osamates that the gork is using for his basting sauce. And there you have it, increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. Low pH, low bicarb, and a compensatory decrease in carbon dioxide. Use the anion gap equation to calculate a gap greater than 12. And sometimes use the osmolal gap equation to see if methanol, propylene glycol, or ethylene glycol is involved. All right, a little twist in the story here. What if the anion gap is less than 12? Simple. We just call it a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. So let's leave the gap behind and catch up with Frodo. Again, we've got decreased pH, decreased bicarb, and a compensatory decrease in CO2. But this time, there are no extra sneaky organic acid ions floating around. Instead, the acidosis is caused by a disproportionate loss of bicarb or an inability of the kidney to reabsorb or regenerate it. Remember, in most cases, when a bicarb is lost, its corresponding proton is retained. Let the acidosis begin. Normally, when bicarb anions go down in the serum, chloride increases correspondingly, thus maintaining isoelectricity. See? As that blue box gets smaller, the yellow chloride box takes its place, and the anion gap stays the same. This is also known as a hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hence the accumulation of chloride crystals above Frodo. All right, let's look at a couple of ways we can decrease bicarb. First, Frodo's main affliction, that excessive diarrhea. It turns out that severe poopy-poopy times can cause metabolic acidosis because of a loss of large amounts of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic secretions. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. I feel it in my pants. Bicarb that once was lost. Precious bicarb. My precious. Calm down, everyone. It's just diarrhea. And as he pulls out that renal tubular vial to light his way, a gift from Lady Glamourdriel. Think of renal tubular acidosis, or RTA, a group of disorders that results in decreased reabsorption of bicarb by the kidney, or a decreased production of bicarb by the kidney, which is paired with the inability to properly excrete H+. You'll encounter a few pathologies throughout this course that affect renal handling of bicarb, like adrenal insufficiency. For more info on RTA, check out their very own sketch coming up next. Alright, that's it for metabolic acidosis. Let's keep the acidosis party going with the other form, respiratory acidosis. Enter Smigasp, the Fellowship's reluctant guide. Though, can't say he's been that helpful so far. He's either talking to himself, or arguing with his reflection, or just strangling himself. Look there, see? He's doing it again. What is he, suffocating himself? I just don't get that guy. Needless to say, Smigasp is going to embody all that is respiratory acidosis. So back to that ABG. The three values we care about are pH, bicarb, and CO2. We're acidotic, so expect the pH to be low, which is why we're low in the scene. This time we're going to look at PaCO2 next. This value is predominantly controlled by the lungs, increase ventilation and you breathe off CO2, decrease ventilation and CO2 accumulates. And that's exactly what's happening in the setting of respiratory acidosis. We're decreasing ventilation and allowing CO2 to accumulate. This pushes the equilibrium to the right, toward more H plus in acidosis. Alright, back to the scene at hand. Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an increase in PaCO2. As depicted by the carbon fume, as depicted by the carbon fumes rising high into the air from the active campsite. Why did Frodo and company have to scramble away from the campsite so quickly? Well, that brings us to the third part of the ABG, bicarb. This value is predominantly controlled by the kidney, which can excrete, retain, or produce new bicarb as needed. But wait, you said respiratory acidosis, not renalatory acidosis. Remember, we're always going to pair the primary acid-base disturbance with the corresponding compensatory acidosis. So, we're going to pair the primary acid-base disturbance with the corresponding compensatory mechanism. In the setting of respiratory acidosis, when that H plus is accumulating, the kidneys kick in, increasing not only bicarb retention, but bicarb production. Yeah, it can make new bicarb, with the corresponding proton excreted in the urine, of course, thereby decreasing H plus to decrease acidity. These compensatory mechanisms never quite get the pH back to baseline, but, you know, they try. The kidneys are pretty slow, too, and this response can take days. Shhh, shhh, shhh, roost on my face and call me a radicast. It's another gork. See how he's lifting that bicarb baking soda from the travel pack? That stands for increased bicarb. So, to recap, in respiratory acidosis, we see low pH, high PaCO2, and a compensatory increase in bicarb by the kidney. All right, let's take a look at a few pathologies that cause patients to retain CO2. First, COPD, as portrayed by that big, blue, bloated, chronically obstructed gork. Patients with COPD chronically retain CO2 due to decreased respiratory drive and impaired gas exchange. For more on COPD, check out the street hockey sketch in the pulmonary unit. Shhh, he's moving. Phew. Anywho, another cause of CO2 retention includes obstructive sleep apnea, which causes obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation at night. Next, how about instead of obstructing ventilation, we decrease the drive to ventilate? This can occur with drugs such as opioids and other sedatives that act as central nervous system depressants. Decreased drive means retained CO2. Man, breathaless saves the day again with that sleeping potion. Using his elf... elf-ish... Is it elfin? Using his elfinoid sneaky sneaky powers. Nailed it. For the next cause of respiratory acidosis, let's look back at poor Smigasp, who was put back in his chains. Guess he ran off one too many times. At Sketchy, a lock around a chest is our symbol for restrictive lung disorders, which include intrapulmonary disorders, such as pulmonary fibrosis, or extra-pulmonary disorders, such as scoliosis, obesity, and pleural effusion. All of these conditions restrict lung movement, thereby impairing ventilation. So expect some CO2 retention. For more info on restrictive lung disease, head on over to the Pullman unit. Another way we can restrict ventilation is by inhibiting the muscles of respiration. See those neuronal dangly bits on Smigasp's unsightly loincloth? Let it remind you of neurological disorders, such as ALS, Guillain-Barre, polio, myasthenia gravis, and botulism that interrupt nerve transmission to the diaphragm. Notice, too, that Smigasp has frail, atrophied muscles. Think of disorders such as muscular dystrophy, when their diaphragm is just too weak to ventilate. Whew, a couple of close calls there. We got through respiratory acidosis. Remember, that's decreased pH, increased PaCO2, and a compensatory increase in bicarb. Alright, time to shift our focus to the top of the sketch, where a couple of Frodo's companions are having a gork problem of their own. But before we head up there, remember that high in the sketch means high pH. We're talking about alkalosis. Just like the acidic chapter of the story, alkalosis can be divided into respiratory and metabolic processes. Take a look at our next gork, enjoying a fresh fish head from the alkaline pools. Again, I think it's pretty obvious which category we're starting with. Munchen is our symbol for metabolic processes. So back to that ABG. The three values we care about are pH, bicarb, and CO2. pH we already discussed. We're alkalotic, so expect the pH to be high. Which is why we're high in this scene. Next, let's look at bicarb. The pathologies we'll encounter in metabolic alkalosis involve increased retention or increased production of bicarb. In most cases, a retained bicarb means a corresponding excreted proton. It's basic science. Basic. So notice that the metabolic alkalosis scene takes place next to the gork rummaging around the active campsite. Bicarb will be increased. The last part of the ABG is PaCO2. In the setting of metabolic alkalosis, compensation comes from the lungs. By decreasing ventilation, we can increase the amount of CO2 in the blood. See how that shifts the buffer system to the right? Adding more H plus to the system? This is how your body tries to fight off metabolic alkalosis, even though it never fully compensates. This is called a compensatory respiratory acidosis, characterized by increased PaCO2 and symbolized here by the carbon fumes rising high into the air from that active campsite. In summary, metabolic alkalosis is characterized by elevated pH, elevated bicarb, and, if there's compensation by the lungs, an elevated CO2. Alright, so what are some examples of increased retention or increased production of bicarb? How about, say, vomiting after eating a slimy fish head from the alkaline pool? Vomiting leads to a loss of HCl from the stomach. And remember how those proton pumps work at the gastric mucosa. For every proton lost in the vomit, there's a corresponding bicarb molecule in the stomach. For every proton lost in the vomit, there's a corresponding bicarb molecule retained by the body. Sounds like alkalosis to me. Diuretics can also increase bicarb and cause metabolic alkalosis. With loop and thiazide diuretic use, reabsorption of sodium and chloride are reduced. Check out the loop and thiazide diuretic sketchy farm sketches for more details. But remember, when you block reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the more proximal segments of the nephron, you're going to get a bad result. Increased sodium delivery to the collecting duct causes increased NaH+. That's reabsorption of sodium and excretion of H+. You know how that goes. Every H plus excreted means a bicarb retained. That H plus had to come from somewhere, right? You know what? It's not like we're in end-stage renal disease or something. Why can't the kidney, which is usually really good at handling bicarb, just dump it all into the urine, correct the alkalosis, and call it a day? Well, it's not that simple. Turns out that both the conditions we just described have a maintenance phase that impairs the kidney's ability to dump bicarb, forcing the body to stay alkalotic. Dang. There are actually many mechanisms thought to play a role. Take volume depletion, for example. I mean, we're peeing and vomiting a lot, right? Hypovolemia stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which tells the kidney to reabsorb sodium and bicarb, and excrete H+. Angiotensin has this effect at the proximal tubule, while aldosterone drives this process at the distal tubule. Wait, excrete even more H+, all so we can conserve all that sodium? Pfft. Fine. There are even more complicated mechanisms involved. But suffice it to say, if we restore volume, we can reverse these annoying H-plus excreting processes that are being driven by hypovolemia. This is called chloride-sensitive alkalosis. As in, if we give normal saline, which contains sodium chloride, and get them back up to euvolemia, say goodbye to alkalosis. This is illustrated by Poppin' Up Top, about to end this alkalosis gork party with a boulder. A bolus, if you will, of chloride crystals. He's got a water bottle on the side of his travel pack, reminiscent of an IV saline bag. By the way, these conditions are associated with chloride depletion, too. With vomiting, the chloride is lost as hydrochloric acid. And in diuretic use, the chloride is excreted with the other ions. So the chloride in the isotonic saline corrects the chloride deficit in these patients, too. It's a win-win-win. Volume, chloride, and pH restoration. But there's one more way to abnormally increase that bicarb. Mineralocorticoid excess. Symbolized here by that huge mineralocorticoid mineral crystal. Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, work at the collecting duct to increase sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, and there it is again, H plus excretion. For every H plus ion lost at the collecting duct, a bicarb molecule is retained. Mineralocorticoid excess is seen in primary hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing syndrome. Go rummage around the sketchy endocrine unit for all the salty deets. Also, keep in mind that sodium retention at the collecting duct means volume retention. So, because we're volume-expanded, none of those silly alkalosis-maintaining hypovolemia mechanisms are at work. Adding saline won't do a thing. Hence the name, chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis. Well, good thing Poppin came through with that crystal rock to the pee-pee. Because that was taking a turn for the... moist. In summation, metabolic alkalosis involves an elevated pH due to increases in bicarb with a compensatory increase in PaCO2 due to hypoventilation. Alright, last but not least, respiratory alkalosis. You know what that means. Elevated pH. So we're staying high in the scene. We're trying to catch up with Murray at the top of the alkaline falls. Trying desperately to get a signal to their wizard friend, Randolph the Beige. Notice that Murray is holding our recurring sketchy symbol for respiratory alkalosis. A hydroxyl-shaped bubble wand. Just think about how much hyperventilation it takes to keep that signal going. So, one more time, let's look at that ABG. Remember, the three values we care about are pH, bicarb, and PaCO2. We're alkalotic, so we expect the pH to be high, which is why we're high in the scene. Next, let's look at PaCO2. This value is predominantly controlled by the lungs. Increase ventilation and you breathe off CO2. See how the equilibrium shifts to the left, causing H plus to decrease? That's respiratory alkalosis. Alright, back to the scene. Low PaCO2 in the setting of hyperventilation is symbolized by the low carbon fumes, close to the ground. Remember, we're blowing off CO2 here. But don't forget about that last part of the ABG, bicarb. Remember Gapwise's bicarb falling into the crevasse? We're bringing it back to represent low bicarb. You see, in the setting of respiratory alkalosis, the kidneys kick in, increasing bicarb excretion and decreasing bicarb production. Remember, in most cases, when a bicarb is lost, its corresponding proton is retained. This helps combat alkalosis. Though, the kidneys can be pretty slow, and this response can take days. Alright, let's look at a few pathologies that can cause hyperventilation and decreased PaCO2. First of all, notice how high he is on those alkaline falls. The air has gotta be thin up there. At high altitude, the decreased oxygen content of the air causes hypoxemia. Peripheral receptors in the carotid and aortic bodies sense a decrease in PaCO2. This is a sign of hyperventilation. Another classic cause of hyperventilation is pulmonary embolism. Both the ensuing hypoxemia, as well as direct irritation in the lung, activate the respiratory centers, resulting in increased ventilation. Notice, too, how Murray looks a little anxious and sweaty as he peers down from the tall cliff. Hyperventilation is a component of panic attacks, which can be seen in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. In general, the symptoms of hyperventilation are the following. 1. Anxiety disorder 2. Anxiety disorder 3. Anxiety disorder 4. Anxiety disorder 5. Anxiety disorder 6. Anxiety disorder 7. Anxiety disorder And Murray's inhaler? That's there to remind you of asthma. Which is kind of like a combination of all of the above. Hypoxemia, lung irritation, and anxiety can all stimulate the respiratory centers to increase ventilation during an acute asthma attack. And Murray's ability to disguise himself as a gork before making his way up the falls? Ingenious. So aspirin is way up here, too. Because, it turns out, aspirin directly stimulates the respiratory centers to increase ventilation. So early in aspirin toxicity, you'll actually see a respiratory alkalosis. The increased anion gap metabolic acidosis that we saw below is slower in onset. Alright, I don't know about you, but that's about as much traveling as I can take in one day. I think it's about time we set up camp. Maybe get a stew going. Get some fresh taters in there. You know, potatoes.\n",

Beta-HCG is a hormone that's initially produced by the placenta in order to support the corpus luteum to continue to make progesterone. Both urine and blood pregnancy tests detect beta-HCG. The urine test is a qualitative, positive or negative, beta-HCG test, and the blood test is usually a quantitative, amount-of-beta-HCG-detected test. If it's a quantitative test, the level of beta-HCG should double every 48 hours and peak at about 10 weeks into the pregnancy. Another way to diagnose pregnancy, and something that's used as an adjunct to urine or serum testing, is ultrasound. With a transvaginal ultrasound, an intrauterine gestational sac should be able to be visualized at 5 weeks. By 6 weeks, a transvaginal ultrasound should be able to see a fetal heart rate.

      " Specifically, we'll start with the cholinomimetic drugs. They're called cholinomimetic because they mimic or modify the effects of acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. For that reason, these drugs are also sometimes referred to as parasympathomimetics. So at this parasympathetic port town, let's sketch in a billboard at the top of the scene that reads, enjoy acetylchola. To remind you that the drugs depicted in the scene are acetylcholine receptor stimulants. This again means that they are cholinomimetic. So on the sign, we have a mime enjoying a refreshing cold bottle of acetylchola. Early studies of the parasympathetic nervous system showed that there are two important acetylcholine receptor subtypes, those stimulated by muscarine or muscarinic receptors, and those stimulated by nicotine or nicotinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors will be represented by a smoker here on the left. These nicotinic receptors are found on autonomic ganglia and skeletal neuromuscular junctions. So to highlight this, let's put some of these ganglia-like transformers on the telephone pole. Think of it as the location where preganglionic wires synapse with...\n",

      " The first of our three-part series on heart failure. This sketch is focused on the clinical presentation of chronic heart failure, which you'll primarily see in the outpatient clinic. In part two of this series, we'll cover the management of chronic heart failure. Finally, we'll finish up in part three with a discussion of acute decompensated heart failure, a super common reason for admission to the inpatient medicine wards. Let's get started with some important definitions of what this mythical condition called heart failure actually is. Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The result is a classic set of symptoms and signs that we'll dive into in a moment. Our recurring sketchy symbol for heart failure is this floppy heart balloon being held by our mermaid protagonist. Get used to it, because we'll be bringing back this symbol over and over. Heart failure can be classified into two different groups based on whether the underlying dysfunction is a squeezing problem or a filling problem. Systolic dysfunction is a fancy term that simply means the left ventricle can't squeeze out as much blood with each contraction as it should. When heart failure occurs primarily due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, we call that heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. To symbolize heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, we've drawn in this awesome sea creature happily playing away on its droopy heart-shaped accordion. I don't know how much music you're gonna make with all those holes in it, but hey.\n",

      " Now, I'll start by drawing this desert background. You'll notice I've gotten really fast at drawing. Yeah, you know, I guess it's just practice, what can I say. Anyway, here's Moses. He's carrying a very impressive golden staff, the golden staff of Staph Aureus. Notice his robes are violet. We did this because Staph Aureus is gram positive. And gram positives take up crystal violet stain in their thick cell wall and hold onto it even after the rinse and the addition of red saffron in. So they appear violet under the microscope. We'll tend to use a lot of violets in the gram positive videos and likewise we'll use reds in the gram negative videos. Let's keep talking about how exactly we can identify Staph Aureus in the lab. So far we've gone over that they're gram positive cocci, but so are strep. So how are you going to tell them apart besides their shape? The first test you'll use is a catalase test. Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide to water and is present in all Staph lococci but not strep. Since Staph is catalase positive, we'll add this cat standing for catalase. You'll notice you won't see a cat in the strep videos or any catalase negative videos. We've placed them right here, front and center, and we've even made them look cool and Egyptian looking so that you don't forget about them. So if it's gram positive and catalase positive, we're pretty certain we're dealing with the Staph. Now how do we know it's Staph Aureus versus a different kind of Staph? Well first Staph Aureus has that nice golden color when plated, but alternatively you can run a coagulation test. Coagulation tests are used to determine the concentration of the Staph Aureus. Coagulation tests are used to determine the concentration of the Staph Aureus. Coagulation tests are used to determine the concentration of the Staph Aureus.

      " Batten down the hatches and check those cleat knots cause a storm is a-brewin'. But that dark sky doesn't just foreshadow trouble on the high seas. It actually is a shadow of a chest, which seems like a pretty solid sign from above on the importance of this sketch, interpreting a chest x-ray. But before we read too far into the meaning of this image, first review the patient's details, the date and time the x-ray was taken, and prior imaging. To analyze a chest x-ray, it's helpful to have a high-quality image, and there are four key factors that contribute to quality. To remember them, have a look at this PIR, which stands for Position, Inspiration, Exposure, and Rotation. Position refers to the position from which the x-ray was taken. Are you looking at a supine AP or PA view or perhaps a lateral view? A PA film, which is taken with the patient in the upright position, has far superior image quality to a supine AP, which is mostly reserved for patients who can't get out of bed. Next, consider if the patient took a deep breath and held it during imaging. With good inspiratory effort, you should see the 8th to 10th posterior ribs. Then there's exposure. The vertebral bodies behind the heart should just be visible on a well-penetrated chest x-ray. And finally, look for rotation in the image. Rotation makes things difficult to interpret, so check the distance between the medial border of the clavicles and spinous processes. If it's not the same on both sides, order another film. Alright, quality image in hand, there's a methodical approach for reading a chest x-ray. Think ABCDE. Boat A here, with its airway-shaped anchor, is a reminder to assess the airway. And for a better view of what we mean, let's draw our ship into this safe harbor. Start at the top of this rope ladder, er, the trachea. The trachea should be positioned at the midline, patent, and not deviated to one side, which can be seen with tension pneumothorax, atelectasis, lung and mediastinal masses, among other things. Notice how the rope ladder splits part way down. That's kinda like how the trachea bifurcates at the carina into the right and left mainstem bronchi. And keep in mind that foreign bodies are more likely to be lodged in the right mainstem bronchus since it's wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left mainstem bronchus. Remember also to check the size, density, and position of the hila or lung roots, which includes the pulmonary vessels, right and left bronchi, and hilar lymph nodes. With the rigging in place, take a breather, because B is up next. Boat B's expanding bulge is a reminder to consider breathing. Begin by looking for the pleura, which should not be visible on a chest x-ray unless there's pleural thickening, as symbolized here by this thick sail cover. Speaking of which, these windblown sails are our recurring symbol for lungs. Yeah, you don't really want to miss those. On a chest x-ray, the lungs are divided into three zones, which take up one third of the height of a lung, similar to how this stitching pattern separates each sail into thirds. Ranging the lungs by zones ensures you don't miss any tiny spots. This sailing vessel is certainly under the weather, but it might just hold up after all, though that sea boat looks like it's taken on some serious water. The rain spilling or circulating from it is a reminder to check for circulation, specifically the great vessels, pulmonary vessels, superior vena cava, and aorta. For the aorta, look for the aortic knob, symbolized by this crow's nest, or knob, a characteristic feature on chest x-ray, and also a good place to avoid during a lightning storm. Oh, good thing we brought this ship into port. There's clearly some precious cargo on board. These heart-labeled crates represent the cardiac silhouette. Be sure to check the relative size and position of the heart. Its borders should appear sharp and well-defined. And to ensure this precious cargo fits snugly topside, let's bring out the measuring tape. The cardiothoracic ratio is routinely used to gauge heart size. To calculate this, measure the maximum length of the cardiac silhouette and divide that by the maximal horizontal thoracic diameter. The CTR is usually less than 0.5 on a normal PA film. Expect a high CTR in a patient with cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. We might not have capsized, but it's still important to survey the damage. Boat D appears to have taken the storm's biggest brunt, and the crossbeams might need a little repair, a reminder to check for bony pathology like rib and clavicle fractures. But for a bit of good news, the hulls are intact, and stretched between them is catamaran netting, our recurring symbol for the diaphragm. Inspect the dome-shaped hemidiaphragms, which should appear sharp and well-defined. Huh, looks like our first mate Gino's been hard at work trying to mitigate the storm's damage. He's hung these buckets to catch rainwater runoff and to symbolize the approximate location of the costophrenic angles, the angle where the diaphragm and thoracic wall meet. As you probably know, in upright patients, fluid can collect here, resulting in a plural effusion. And speaking of effusions, letter E also stands for equipment and everything else. Ah, Gino! There you are. Let this serve as a reminder to check for lines, tubes, surgical clips, and sternotomy wires. And when we say everything else, we mean it. Don't forget to look for a pacemaker or ICD and leads, represented here by these windropes hanging off the sailboat. Hang on, Gino! Almost done with the sketch. Looking good, buddy. Just a quick look below the board, where these air bubbles bubbling out of a gas can represent the gastric bubble. And underneath the left hemidiaphragm, the gastric bubble is a normal finding on a chest x-ray. Ooh, that didn't sound good. A warning worth eating. Lots of students confuse the gastric bubble with pneumoperitoneum. That's free air underneath the diaphragm, typically from a perforated viscous. Pneumoperitoneum is an abnormal finding, and the treatment depends on the cause, but we'll save those spicy details for another time. All right, now that you know the ropes, time to recheck the rigging and review this sketch before we set sail. Prior to looking at a chest x-ray or any imaging, review the patient's details, the date and time the image was taken, and previous imaging. Next, check for position, inspiratory effort, exposure, and rotation to confirm image quality. Then use the ABCDE method to interpret a chest x-ray. To begin, check the airway, which includes the trachea, carinae, right and left main stem bronchi, and hilar structures. Next, check breathing, specifically the pleura and lungs. Then assess circulation, including the cardiac silhouette and great vessels. After that, check for damage in the bones and the diaphragm. Remember to check the costophrenic angles for a pleural effusion. Check all of your equipment. An endotracheal tube, a central venous catheter, a nasogastric tube, surgical clips, a pacemaker or ICD, and everything else. This tempest doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon, and to be honest, I'm a bit of a landlubber. Time to seek shelter. Hang on, Gino. I'll, um, I'll be right back. Um, do you want a soda? Meow!\n",

      " Welcome back to Sketchy Micro, this is Saud. In this video we'll be covering Proteus Mirabilis. When you hear the word Proteus, you may think of Proteus the Greek god of the sea. Well, Proteus would be a god in our story too, but he's going to be the god of the public restroom. Before we draw, let's go over some key points. First of all, Proteus is a gram negative facultative anaerobe and demonstrates swarming motility when plated. Proteus may also be described as having a fishy odor. Proteus is a common cause of urinary tract infections, and what's high yield about this is that it is urease positive. What does this mean? It means that Proteus can break down the urea in our urine into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This ammonia then alkalizes the urine and results in struvite stone formation. Note that examiners may not give you the word struvite, but may simply refer to them as ammonium magnesium phosphate stones. Kidney stones may cause difficulty urinating in patients. Any type of stone formed by infection can also grow quickly and become a staghorn calculi. These are large stones that take the shape of the renal pelvis. Finally, to treat Proteus infections, sulfa drugs are commonly used. Let's start sketching this out to help you remember what we just taught you. Let's start off by drawing Proteus, the god of the public restroom. We'll draw him as half man and half octopus with swarming tentacles to remind us that Proteus demonstrates swarming motility. Next, we're going to draw staghorns on his head to remind us of staghorn calculi formation. To remember that Proteus is urease positive and that it produces ammonia in the urine, we're going to equip our restroom god with an ammonia spray bottle. He uses a spray bottle to keep the restrooms clean. The restroom god hates when people come in and urinate after he's been doing so much cleaning. To fend them off, he throws rocks at them while they're at the urinals. These stones will remind you of the kidney stones that Proteus can create. The stone throwing makes the person urinating nervous and makes it hard for them to pee. This reminds you that examiners may include difficulty urinating when describing Proteus urinary tract infection symptoms. Now, we'll surround Proteus with fish. This will remind you that Proteus may be described as having a fishy odor. Lastly, we'll put a rotten egg here. This will be our symbol for sulfa drugs because rotten eggs have a sulfur-like smell. Use this to remind you that Proteus is treated with sulfa drugs. We hope this lesson will help you remember these key features of Proteus mirabilis. Follow us on Twitter and visit our website to stay updated and to download the PDF of this sketch. We'll be sure to follow your comments on YouTube as well to make sure you know what we're doing right and what we can improve upon.\n",

      " Hi, welcome back to Sketching Micro, this is Andrew. We're going to be covering Salmonella, and specifically two subspecies of Salmonella, Salmonella typhi and Salmonella interidatis. And although these subspecies are very different, I think there are enough shared features that it warrants us including them in the same sketch. This way we can really clump together the commonalities and then highlight the differences. Alright, so let's get to sketching this out. I think the topic for this sketch should be a salmon dinner. Salmon is a pretty obvious association with Salmonella, I imagine you guys have at least subconsciously made that association, so let's not change it. But I think having it be a dinner will allow us to expand more and include more features. Let's start by drawing a table, and then on top of the table we'll have our salmon dish. A little thing that we'll include with the salmon is to have the tail flopping around, just to give action to it so that you remember that Salmonella is modal. That's a big feature, Salmonella is modal. And as a quick tie in to this, it's also H2S positive. You can remember that all enteric bacteria that are modal are also H2S positive, which means that it grows black colonies on the hecto and auger plate. But just to really drill it in, we'll go ahead and paint the plate that the fish is on black. So that black plate should trigger a memory of black colonies on the hecto and auger plate, which means H2S positive. Another shared feature between both Salmonella subspecies is that they're encapsulated. You can represent this by just drawing a glass dome over the salmon dish. I like this, it kind of looks like what those fancy bakeries use to serve their pastries. Should be a good reminder. The next feature that both share is that they're acid labile. This is important because if they're acid labile, they get easily degraded in the stomach. So that means that you need a really high dose to cause infection. This is opposed to Shigella, which isn't acid labile and only needs a few organisms to cause infection. So then additionally, it would make sense that if you were taking Omeprazole or had pernicious anemia or had any other conditions that lowered stomach acidity, you'd be more susceptible to infection. So how do we remember this? Well, a lot of people like lemon with their salmon, so we can add a slice of lemon, which you would equate with acid, and you'll just have to remember that it's acid labile. So now it's time to differentiate between the two subspecies of Salmonella. Here on the left, we'll have Salmonella interiditis, and on the right, Salmonella typhi. On the left, we'll have a chicken. This will remind us that we acquire Salmonella interiditis by eating undercooked chickens, and that chickens are the main reservoir. Okay, on the other side of the page, we'll have a seagull. This is to represent gallbladder. I know it's a little more of a stretch, but I think you should be okay with it. And this is to remind us that chronic carriers of Salmonella typhi harbor it in their gallbladder. Let's focus in on Salmonella typhi for a bit, and also strengthen the connection between Salmonella typhi and the seagull by adding this apron on the seagull. This will help remind us of typhoid Mary, the chef. If you haven't heard about typhoid Mary, I'd check it out quickly on Wikipedia. It's somewhat interesting, and it might help you remember. We'll add red spots to the apron to represent the rose spots, or red macules, that patients with enteric fever get on their abdomen. This only happens about 25% of the time, but that's enough for it to be testable, so you'll want to be able to recognize it. One of the important clinical features we have to remember for Salmonella typhi is that it's the number one cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease. So we'll go ahead and erase the head of the salmon and expose the bones. This should help you remember osteomyelitis. Then we'll add a sickle to the hand of the seagull, and have it looming ominously right above the bone, and that should be a strong enough association. Typhoid fever is generally associated with constipation, but it can cause diarrhea, and when it does, it's said to resemble pea soup. So we'll go ahead and draw some bird droppings here, the color of pea soup, to help remind you of that. Another difference between Salmonella typhi and Enteritidis is that typhi is treated with an antibiotic, most often a fluoroquinolone. So we'll go ahead and draw a flower on the table closest to the seagull to represent fluoroquinolone. Salmonella typhi also has a live attenuated vaccine. We'll draw this syringe, and it'll be sticking the leg of the seagull. This should remind you that it's Salmonella typhi and not Salmonella Enteritidis that has the vaccine. Alright, let's bring our attention back to the chicken. The main thing I want you to remember is that Salmonella Enteritidis causes inflammatory diarrhea. So we'll show you by having the chicken light the candle, and this flame will remind you of inflammatory. A virulent factor for Salmonella that you'll also see pop up for Shigella and Yersinia pestis is that it contains a type 3 secretion system. This is a protein that not only detects eukaryotic cells, but when it does, it secretes a protein that helps with infectivity. And unfortunately, this is something you'll have to remember. We'll draw this turkey baster near the chicken, and this will be a symbol for the type 3 secretion system. We'll keep reusing it in future drawings, and hopefully by then it'll be really fixed. We're almost done with the sketch, but there is one more point I want to bring up about the pathogenesis of both subtypes. So say we do ingest a dose sufficient enough to cause disease. What happens is it passes through the stomach, through the small intestine, into the colon, and there it invades the lymphatics. It actually gets taken up by macrophages and then carried into the blood. So the important point is that it's facultative intracellular, but specifically within macrophages. So we're going to draw these bird cages behind both birds, and the doors are open. So this kind of signifies that they can go in and out of the cages, okay? That represents facultative intracellular. You can remember that it's macrophages because it rhymes with cages, or if that doesn't work, we'll just write the M5 symbol on the cages, and if you're a visual learner, you'll remember it that way. And that's all the information we're going to cram into this sketch. Let's go over it all again one more time. First we have the salmon, representing Salmonella. Then we have his tail flapping around to remind you that it's modal. We painted the plate black to remind you of H2S positive and that it forms black colonies on the hecto and auger plate. We have this glass dome representing the capsule, and the side of lemons will represent that it's acid labile. On the left, the chicken will represent Salmonella interuditus, it's also the reservoir. On the right we have the seagull for Salmonella typhi, seagull for gallbladder, which is the reservoir. The apron serves a dual purpose, it reminds us of typhoid Mary the Chef, and the rose spots seen in typhoid fever. The seagull's holding the sickle above the fish bones to remind us of osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients. And we have the pea soup droppings for pea soup diarrhea. We have the syringe representing the live attenuated vaccine, and the flower for fluoroquinolones. The turkey baster is the type 3 secretion system, the matches are for inflammatory diarrhea, and the two cages in the back have their doors open to remind us that they're facultative intracellular and macrophages. This is our fast recall symbol for Salmonella, it's red because Salmonella is gram negative, and gram negatives show up red on gram stain. We'll refer back to this symbol in future drawings to group organisms and re-access your memory of this sketch. Finally, I want to challenge you to think about Salmonella in one week, and see how much you remember. I'm sure you'll be surprised. That's it for Salmonella, there is a lot of information but I think it's very manageable. Follow us on Twitter for updates and check us out at www.SketchyMicro.com. There you can print up some pdfs to take notes or even add to the sketches. And we'll check out your comments on YouTube so that we know what we're doing right, and what we can improve upon. Thanks a lot!\n"
