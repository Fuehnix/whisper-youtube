 Specifically, we'll start with the cholinomimetic drugs. They're called cholinomimetic because they mimic or modify the effects of acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. For that reason, these drugs are also sometimes referred to as parasympathomimetics. So at this parasympathetic port town, let's sketch in a billboard at the top of the scene that reads, enjoy acetylchola. To remind you that the drugs depicted in the scene are acetylcholine receptor stimulants. This again means that they are cholinomimetic. So on the sign, we have a mime enjoying a refreshing cold bottle of acetylchola. Early studies of the parasympathetic nervous system showed that there are two important acetylcholine receptor subtypes, those stimulated by muscarine or muscarinic receptors, and those stimulated by nicotine or nicotinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors will be represented by a smoker here on the left. These nicotinic receptors are found on autonomic ganglia and skeletal neuromuscular junctions. So to highlight this, let's put some of these ganglia-like transformers on the telephone pole. Think of it as the location where preganglionic wires synapse with...
